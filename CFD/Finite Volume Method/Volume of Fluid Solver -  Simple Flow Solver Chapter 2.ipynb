    "# Simple Flow Solver\n",
    "\n",
    "We start by describing a very simple Navier-Stokes solver for variable density flow. We will ignore surface tension, assume that the viscosities of both fluids are the same and use a first oder time integration. To solve the density advection equation\n",

    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "By starting simple we will ensure that we always have a working code and this approach will also, hopefully, help the reader develop both an understanding of the code and good programming habits.\n",

    "\n",
    "The momentum equation when surface tenison is neglected, there is no body force except gravity and the viscosity of both of the fluids is the same is\n",
